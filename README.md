Description:

  Wordle Rush is a variation of Wordle that lets the player guess through consecutive rounds. Each round, the player must guess the correct word in under 1-2 minutes.

How to play:

  When the game is launched, the timer starts at 2:00 and will start counting down when you type the first letter. 
  
  Once the timer starts, there will be no way to pause it until you run out of guesses or time.
  
  To reset the game, click the refresh button in the row of icons to the left of the title (alternatively you can press tab).
  
  The icon in the middle represents your stats throughout the game. They will update after every round and will be reset when you reset the game.
  
  The audio icon allows you to mute/unmute the background music.
